# What i learn
<ul>
<li>Always try to create functions outside the event listeners and whatever error handling is there should also be in those functions to avoid some problems while working with event listeners</li>
<li>I always wanted to learn about grids which i think it is more powerful to create layouts easily as we want, so i tried applying grids in css which i don't use alot</li>
</ul>
